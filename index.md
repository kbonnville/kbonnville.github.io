I’m a researcher working with **remote sensing**, **hydrology**, and **GIS**.  
This is my personal site where I share projects, ideas, and resources.

## Projects
- **Wetland monitoring using X-band SAR** — surface water mapping and trends
- **Geolocation offsets in Alaska lakes** — accuracy + incidence angle effects
- **Surface-water dynamics visualization** — reproducible, open workflows

## About
I focus on integrating Capella/ICEYE X-band SAR with optical datasets to map surface water, lake areas, and hydrologic change across Alaska, the Everglades, and the Pantanal.
